- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

someAsyncOperation
110ms have passed since I was scheduled
The async operation will be executed first.

The order of execution doesn't change, as I/O operation always takes precedence.

When timeout is , it gives the output :

3ms have passed since I was scheduled
someAsyncOperation

This is because, since, timeout is 0 it directly goes to pending call backs before I/O
